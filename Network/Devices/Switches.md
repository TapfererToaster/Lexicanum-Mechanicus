# Frame Forwarding Methods
Switches use one of two forwarding methods:
- **Store and forward switching**:
  The switch receives the frame, checks the CRC and forwards the frame if it is not corrupted
- **Cut-through switching**:
  The switch forwards the frame before it is entirely received, the destination address of the frame must be read before the frame can be forwarded

Store and forward switching reduces the amount of bandwidth consumed by corrupted data and is necessary for Quality of Service analysis where frame classification for traffic prioritization is necessary, f.e. *Voice over IP (VoIP)* has a priority over web-browsing
## Store and Forward Switching
![[Store and Forward switcing.png]]
The two primary characteristics are:
- **Error checking**: After receiving the frame the switch compares the CRC of the frame with its own
- **Automatic Buffering:** ingress port buffering supports any mix of Ethernet speeds, f.e. a frame coming into a 100 Mbps Port that must be sent out a 1 Gbps port, the switch stores the frame in a buffer 
## Cut-Through Switching
![[Cut Through Switching.png]]
There are two ways of cut-through switching
- **Fast-forward switching**:
  forwards the frame after reading the destination address; has the lowest level of latency and is the typical cut-through switching method
- **Fragment-free switching**:
  the switch stores the first 64 bytes of the frame before forwarding; can be seen as a compromise between store-and-forward switching and cut-through switching

# Memory Buffering
There are two ways of memory buffering:
- **Port-based memory**:
	- frames are stored in a queues linkes to a specific port
	- frames are transmitted only if all frames before it are transmitted
- **Shared memory**:
	- all frames are stored in a memory buffer shared by all ports which is dynamically allocated
	- enables to store larger frames with fewer dropped frames


# Basic Switch Stuff

## Switch Boot Sequence
- **Step 1**:
  First, the Switch loads a *power-on self-test (POST)* program stored in ROM. POST checks the CPU, DRAM and the portion of the flash device that makes up the flash file system.
- **Step 2**:
  Next, the switch loads the boot loader software. The boot loader is a small program stored in ROM that is run immediately after POST successfully completes.
- **Step 3**:
  The boot loader performs low-level CPU initialization. It initializes the CPU registers, which control where physical memory is mapped, the quantity of memory and its speed.
- **Step 4**:
  The boot loader initializes the flash file system on the system board.
- **Step 5**: 
  The boot loader locates and loads a default IOS operating system image into memory and gives control of the switch over to the IOS.

## boot system Command
The switch attempts to automatically boot by using information in the BOOT environment variable. If this variable is not set, the switch attempts to load and execute the first executable file it can find.
The IOS operating system then initializes the interfaces using the [[Cisco IOS CLI]] commands found in the startup-config file, called `config.txt` and is located in flash.

To set the BOOT environment variable we use the `boot system` command in [[Cisco IOS CLI#Global configuration mode| global configuration mode]]. 
```
S1(config)# boot system flash:/c2960-lanbasek9-mz.150-2.SE/c2960-lanbasek9-mz.150-2.SE.bin
```

| Command                           | Definition              |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `boot system`                     | main command            |
| `flash:`                          | storage device          |
| `c2960-lanbasek9-mz.150-2.SE`     | path to the file system |
| `c2960-lanbasek9-mz.150-2.SE.bin` | IOS file name           |
>[!tip]
>Use the command `show boot` to see the current IOS boot file.

## Switch LED Indicators
![[Switch LED indicators.png]]
1. **SYST**: System LED
   Shows whether the system is receiving power and is functioning properly.
   -  LED is *off*: it means the system is not powered on.
   - LED ist *blinking green*: the system is operating normally.
   - LED is *amber*: the system is receiving power but is not functioning properly.
1. **RPS**: Redundant Power System LED
   Shows the RPS status. 
   - LED is *off*: the RPS is off or it is not properly connected. 
   - LED is *green*: the RPS is connected and ready to provide backup power. 
   - LED is *blinking green*: the RPS is connected but is unavailable because it is providing power to another device. 
   - LED is *amber*: the RPS is in standby mode or in a fault condition. 
   - LED is *blinking amber*: the internal power supply in the switch has failed and the RPS is providing power.
1. **STAT**: Port Status LED
   -  LED is *green*: port status mode is selected
   - Port LED is *green*: a link is present
   - Port LED is *off*: no link present, port was administratively shut down
   - Port LED is *alternating green-amber*: there is a link fault
   - Port LED is *amber*: port is blocked and will not forward data (ensures there is no loop in the forwarding domain)
   - Port LED is *blinking amber*: port is blocked to prevent a possible loop in the forwarding domain.
1. **DUPLX**: Port Duplex LED
   - LED is *green*: port duplex mode is selected
   - Port LED is *green*: the port is in full-duplex mode 
   - Port LED is *off*: port is in half-duplex mode
1. **SPEED**: Port Speed LED
   Indicates that the port speed mode is selected.
   - Port LED is *off*: port is operating at 10 Mbps
   - Port LED is *green*: port is operating at 100 Mbps
   - Port LED is *blinking green*: port is operating at 1000 Mbps
1. **PoE**: Power over Ethernet Mode LED
   - LED is *off*: PoE mode is not selected
   - LED is *blinking amber*: PoE mode is not selected but at least one port has been denied PoE or has a PoE fault.
   - LED is *green*: PoE mode is selected
   - Port LED is *off*: PoE is off
   - Port LED is *green*: PoE is on
   - Port LED is *alternating green-amber*: PoE is denied, because providing power to the device will exceed the switch power capacity.
   - Port LED is *blinking amber*: PoE is off because of a fault
   - Port LED is *amber*: PoE has been disabled

## Recovering from a System Crash 
The boot loader provides access into the files stored in the flash memory of the switch if the operating system cannot be used because of missing or damaged system files. 
The boot loader command-line interface can be accessed through a console connection following these steps:
- **Step 1**: Connect a PC by console cable to the switch console port. Configure terminal emulation software to connect to the switch.
- **Step 2**: Unplug the switch power chord.
- **Step 3**: Reconnect the power chord to the switch and, within 15 seconds, press and hold the "Mode" button while the System LED is still flashing green
- **Step 4**: Continue pressing the "Mode" button until the System LED turns briefly amber and then solid green
- **Step 5**: The boot loader `switch:` prompt appears in the terminal emulation software on the PC

>[!tip] 
>Type `help` or `?` at the boot loader prompt to view a list of available commands.,

By default, the switch attempts to automatically boot up by using information in the BOOT environment variable. To view the path of the switch BOOT environment variable type the `set` command. Then initialize the flash file system using the `flash_init` command to view the current files in flash.

>[!example] Example Output
>```
>switch: set
BOOT=flash:/c2960-lanbasek9-mz.122-55.SE7/c2960-lanbasek9-mz.122-55.SE7.bin
(output omitted)
switch: flash_init

flashfs[0]: Bytes available: 20675584
flashfs[0]: flashfs fsck took 10 seconds.
...done Initializing Flash.
>```

After flash has finished initializing you can enter the `dir flash:` command to view the directories and files in flash

> [!example] Example Output
> 
> ```
> switch: dir flash:
> Directory of flash:/
>     2  -rwx  11834846  \<date>         c2960-lanbasek9-mz.150-2.SE8.bin
>     3  -rwx  2072      \<date>               multiple-fs
> ```
> 

To change the BOOT environment variable path use the command `BOOT=flash` and verify it by issuing the `set` command again. To load the new IOS, type the `boot` command without any arguments.

> [!example] Example Output
> ```
> switch: **BOOT=flash:c2960-lanbasek9-mz.150-2.SE8.bin**
> switch: set
> BOOT=flash:c2960-lanbasek9-mz.150-2.SE8.bin
> (output omitted)
> switch: boot
> ```

>[!note]
>The boot loader commands support initializing flash, formatting flash, installing a new IOS, changing the BOOT environment variable and recovery of lost or forgotten passwords.
# Port Configuration
## Duplex Communication
- **Full-duplex**:
  increases bandwidth efficiency by allowing both ends of the connection to transmit and receive data simultaneously. This is called bidirectional communication and it requires microsegmentation. There is no collision domain associated with a switch port in full-duplex mode. Have replaced half-duplex switches and is now used by default.
  ![[Full-duplex Communication.png]]
  
  >[!note] Microsegmented LAN
  >A microsegmented LAN is created when a switch port has only one device connected and is operating in full-duplex mode. 
- **Half-duplex**:
  half-duplex communication is unidirectional. It also creates performance issues because data can only flow in one direction, often resulting in collisions. It is typically seen in older hardware, such as hubs and have been replaced by full-duplex switches.
  ![[Half-duplex Communication.png]]

To configure Switch ports use the commands `duplex` and `speed` 
```
S1(config-if) duplex full
S1(config-if) speed 100
``` 

>[!note]
>When the 10/100/1000 ports are set to 10 or 100 Mbps they can operate in both half- and full-duplex. If the ports are set to 1000 Mbps they can only operate in full-duplex.

>[!tip]
>When troubleshooting switch port issues, it is important that the duplex and speed settings should be checked, as mismatched settings for the duplex mode and speed can cause connectivity issues.
>Autonegotiation failure creates mismatched settings.
## Auto MDI-X
To configure [[Cables, Connectors and Ports#Auto MDI-X|auto MDI-X]]  you can use
```
S1(config-if) mdix auto
```

>[!note]
>When using auto MDI-X on an interface, the speed and duplex must be set to `auto` to operate correctly.

## Interface Errors
### Input Errors
Input errors is the sum of all errors that were received on the interface.
The errors include: 
- runts
- giants
- CRC 
- no buffer
- frame
- overrun
- ignored counts.

>[!tip]
>On Ethernet and serial interfaces CRC errors usually indicate a media or cable error. If there are too many CRC errors, there is too much noise on the link and you should inspect the cable.
>
### Output Errors
Output errors is the sum of all errors that prevented the final transmission of data out of the interface.
The errors include:
- Collisions
- Late Collisions

>[!tip]
>You should never see Collisions occur on an interface set to full duplex.
>
>Late Collisions can be caused by excessive cable lengths or by duplex misconfiguration. When one of a connection is set to full duplex and the other end is set to half-duplex, late collisions will occur on the half-duplex interface.

# Frame Switching
>[!important] Ingress and Egress
>- **Ingress**: the port where a frame enters the device.
>  - **Egress**: the port that frames will use when leaving the device.
## MAC Address learning
When a switch has to forward a frame it uses a *MAC address table*, which lists the [[(OSI) Open Systems Interconnection-Modell#MAC Addresses| MAC addresses]] and which port the device is connected to to determine the frames destination.
When a Switch receives a frame on one of its ports, it examines the [[Ethernet#Destination and Source|Source field]] and creates an entry for that MAC address and port in its MAC address table.

>[!note]
>MAC addresses learned by a switch in this manner are known as *dynamic MAC addresses*—they are automatically (dynamically) learned. This is in contrast to *static MAC addresses*, which are manually (statically) configured, although that is quite rare. A switch will remove a dynamic MAC address from its MAC address table after 5 minutes of inactivity (if it doesn’t receive a frame from that MAC address for 5 minutes); this is called MAC aging.

## Frame flooding and forwarding
After a Switch has learned the [[(OSI) Open Systems Interconnection-Modell#MAC Addresses|MAC address]] of each host, it can simply look up the destination MAC of a frame in its table and send the frame out of the right port. 
>[!info]
>Frames that are addressed to one destination host are known as *unicast frames*.
>If the switch already has an entry for the destination MAC in its MAC address table it is called a *known unicast address*.
>If the switch does not have an entry it is called a *unknown unicast frame*.

When a Switch receives a unicast frame for a destination MAC address that it does not have an entry for, it *floods* the frame out all ports, except the port the frame was received on. This is done so the frame potentially reaches the destination host and the switch can learn the MAC and port combination when the destination host replies.
Hosts that receive the frame and notice that the destination MAC in the frame is different from their own MAC address will drop the frame.
A switch that receives a flooded frame will also flood the frame out all ports.
![[Fram flooding.png]]
![[Frame flooding reply.png]]
>[!note]
>Switches are *transparent* to the connected hosts, meaning the hosts address their frames directly to each and not to the Switches.

# Collision and Broadcast Domains
## Collision Domains
A *collision domain* is the network segment that shares the same bandwidth between devices. When two or more devices in a collision domain try to communicate at the same time, a collision will occur. 

>[!note]
>There are no collisions when switch ports operate in full-duplex.

## Broadcast Domains
A collection of interconnected switches form a single *broadcast domain*, which can only be divided by a network layer device, such as a router.

>[!note]
Routers divide both broadcast and collision domains.

## Alleviate Network Congestion
Characteristics of switches that alleviate network congestion:
- Interconnected switch ports will attempt by default to establish a link in full-duplex
- **Fast port speeds**
  Switches with faster port speed can reduce congestion:
	- Access layer switches: 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps port speed
	- Distribution layer switches: 100 Mbps, 1Gps and 10 Gbps
	- Core layer and data center switches; 10 Gbps, 40 Gbps and 100 Gbps
- **Fast internal switching**
  Switches use a fast internal bus or shared memory to provide high performance
- **Large frame buffer**
  Switches use large memory buffers to temporarily store more received frames before having to start dropping them. This enables ingress traffic from faster ports (f.e. 1 Gbps) to be forwarded to a slower egress port (f.e. 100 Mbps) without losing frames.
- **High port density**
  High port density reduces costs ( buying 2 48 port switches instead of 4 24 port switches) and helps to keep traffic local, which helps alleviate congestion.

# Switch Configuration
#Cisco_CLI
## Interfaces
```
SW1(config)# interface switch-interface
SW1(config-if)# description descriptionText
SW1(config-if)# speed DataRate 
SW1(config-if)# duplex Duplex
```

### Speed
- maximum rate at which the interface can send and receive traffic in bits per second
- *FastEthernet*: supports 10 and 100 Mbps
- *GigabitEthernet*: supports 10, 100 and 1000 Mbps
- *autonegotiation* automatically determines the matching speed between two devices and is enabled by default

>[!tip]
>If the neighboring device does not use autonegotiation, you should manually configure the speed setting

**Example**
```
SW1(config)# interface g0/1
SW1(config-if)# speed ?
 10 Force 10 Mbps operation 
 100 Force 100 Mbps operation 
 1000 Force 1000 Mbps operation 
 auto Enable AUTO speed configuration 
SW1(config-if)# speed 1000
```

### Duplex
The *duplex* setting refers to whether it is able to send and receive data at the same time or not:
- *Half duplex*: The interface cannot send and receive data at the same time
- *Full duplex*: The interface can send and receive data at the same time

**Example**
```
SW1# configure terminal
SW1(config)# interface g0/1 
SW1(config-if)# duplex full 
SW1(config-if)# interface range f0/1-2 
SW1(config-if)# duplex auto
```

## Secure Remote Access
### Telnet
### SSH
#### Verify the Switch supports SSH
To verify if a switch supports SSH you can use the `show version` command and check if the IOS filename includes a `k9`
```
S1# show version
Cisco IOS Software, C2960 Software (C2960-LANBASEK9-M), Version 15.0(2)SE7, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)
```

You can also use the `show ip ssh` command, if the switch des not support SSH the command will not be recognized. 
#### Configure SSH
1. **Verify SSH support**
```
S1# show ip ssh
```
2. **Configure IP domain**
   With the command `ip domain-name domainName`
```
S1(config)# ip domain-name cisco.com
```
3. **Generate RSA key pairs**
   >[!note]
   >To delete the key pair use `crypto key zeroize rsa`
   >
   
```
S1(config)# crypto key generate rsa
How many bits in the modulus [512]: 1024
```   
4. **Configure user authentication**
   Command: `username userName secret password`
```
S1(config)# username admin secret ccna
```
5. **Configure vty lines**
   Command: `transport input ssh`
```
S1(config)# line vty 0 15
S1(config-line)# transport input ssh
S1(config-line)# login local
S1(config-line)# exit
```
6. **Enable SSH version 2**
```
S1(config)# ip ssh version 2
```
#### Verify SSH is Operational
1. **Connect to the switch with PuTTy**
2. **Login**
```
Login as: admin
Using keyboard-interactive
Authentication.
Password:
S1> enable
Password:
S1#
```
3. **Display SSH version and configuration**
```
S1# show ip ssh
SSH Enabled - version 2.0
Authentication timeout: 120 secs; Authentication retries: 3
To check the SSH connections to the device, use the show ssh command as shown.
S1# show ssh
%No SSHv1 server connections running.
Connection Version Mode Encryption  Hmac                State          Username
0          2.0     IN   aes256-cbc  hmac-sha1    Session started       admin
0          2.0     OUT  aes256-cbc  hmac-sha1    Session started       admin
```

## Configure Default Gateway
To configure the default gateway use the `ip default-gateway ipaddress` command in global configuration mode
```
Switch(config)# ip default-gateway 192.168.1.1
```

## Management Access and SVI Configuration
To prepare  a switch for remote management access, the switch must have *switch virtual interface (SVI)* configured with an IP address and subnet mask or an IPv6 address and prefix. Further to access the switch from a remote network, the switch needs a default gateway. 

By default the switch can be managed through VLAN1, but also all ports are assigned to VLAN1, because of that it is better to use another VLAN for configuration, such as VLAN99.
- **Step 1**: Configure the Management Interface
  - Enter global configuration mode: `S1# configure terminal`
  - Enter SVI interface configuration mode: `S1(config)# interface vlan 99`
  - Configure the IPv4 address: `S1(config-if)# ip address 172.17.99.11 255.255.255.0`
  - Configure the IPv6 address: `S1(config-if)# ipv6 address 2001:db8:acad:99::11/64`
  - Enable the interface: ``S1(config-if)# no shutdown`
  - Return to the privileged EXEC mode: ``S1(config-if) end#`
  - Save the config: `S1# copy running-config sartup-config`
- **Step 2**: Configure the Default Gateway
	- Configure the default gateway: `S1(config)# ip default-gateway 172.17.99.1`
	- Return to privileged EXEC mode: `S1(config)# end`
	- Save the config: `S1# copy running-config sartup-config`
- **Step 3**: Verify Configuration
	- `S1# show ip interface brief`
	- `S1# show ipv6 interface brief`

## STP configuration
### Bridge Priority
To configure a switch's root priority with `spanning-tree vlan vlan-id priority priority-value`
```
SW1(config)# spanning-tree vlan 1 priority 24576
```
>[!note]
>The bridge priority must be in increments of 4096

You can also configure the priority of a switch with `spanning-tree vlan vlan-id root {primary | secondary}` 
```
SW1(config)# spanning-tree vlan 1 root primary
```

>[!note]
>This method is not recommended as configuring a switch as `secondary` does not guarantee that it will be set as the root bridge if the original fails. Another reason is that setting a switch to `primary` does not always work as the command cannot set the priority to 0.
>The best method to set a switch as the root bridge is by setting the priority to 0.
## Security Configuration
### Port Security

#### Secure Unused Ports
It is best practice to disable all unused switch ports, by either navigating to each individual unused port or by defining a range of ports and then using the `shutdown` command:
```
Switch(config)# interface range fa0/8 - 24
Switch(configif-range)# shutdown
```
>[!note]
>If the switch ports are needed simply activate them with the `no shutdown` command.

#### Enable Port Security
Port security limits the number of valid MAC addresses allowed on a port.
To enable port security navigate to the port and use the `switchport port-security` command.
>[!important]
>The `switchport port-security` command can only be used on manually configured [[(VLAN) Virtual LAN#Access Port Assignment|access]] or [[(VLAN) Virtual LAN#Trunk Configuration|trunk]] ports.he number of valid MAC addresses allowed on a port.

```
Switch(config)# interface f0/1
# if not already configured
Switch(config-if)# switchport mode access/trunk
Switch(config-if)# switchport port-security
```

>[!warning]
>If the switch detects multiple unique MAC addresses on the port, the port transitions to an `error-disabled` state and blocks traffic on it. Further all dynamically learned addresses will be forgotten. 

Use `show port-security interface` to display the current security settings of a port.
```
Switch# show port-security interface f0/1
```
#### Limit MAC Addresses
Set a maximum number of MAC addresses allowed on a port use:
```
Switch(config-if)# switchport port-security maximum value

S1(config)# interface f0/1
S1(config-if)# switchport port-security maximum 50
```
#### Learn MAC Addresses
On a secure port the switch can learn MAC addresses in three ways:
- **Manually Configures**
  The administrator manually configures a static MAC address with the following command for each address
  ```
  Switch(config-if)# switchport port-security mac-address macAddress (vlan vlanName)
  Switch(config-if)# switchport port-security mac-address aa:bb:cc:11:22:33 (vlan HQ)
  ```
- **Dynamically Learned**
  When the `switchport port-security`command is entered, the current source MAC for the device connected to the port is automatically secured but is not added to the startup configuration. If the switch is rebooted, the port will have to re-learn the device's MAC address.
- **Dynamically Learned Sticky**
  With this command the switch learns the MAC address dynamically and "stick" it to the running configuration. When saving the running config the MAC address is saved to NVRAM.
  ```
  Switch(config-if)# switchport port-security mac-address sticky
  ```

>[!note]
>A MAC address learned on a `port-security` enabled port is called a *secure MAC address*.

#### Port Security violation modes
Security *violation modes* are used to configure the behavior of a `port-security` enabled port when a security violation occurs.
These modes are:
- **shutdown**
  the port is shut down and all communication is stopped
- **restrict**
  frames that violate the MAC address limit are discarded, but communication with already known MAC is continued, the violation counter is incremented with each violating frame, generates a Syslog message and SNMP Traps/Informs
- **protect**
  frames that violate the MAC address limit are discarded, communication is continued and the violation counter is not incremented

To configure a violation mode on a port use:
```
S1(config)# interface f0/1
S1(config-if)# switchport port-security violation restrict
```
#### Secure MAC address aging
>[!note] Reminder
>MAC address aging refers to the time a MAC address is stored in the MAC address table before it is discarded. The timer resets whenever a frame from the corresponding address is received.

By default secure MAC addresses do not age and stay in the address table as long as the port it was learned on stays up.
To enable secure MAC address aging use 
```
SW1(config)# interface f0/1
SW1(config-if)# switchport port-security aging time minutes

SW1(config-if)# switchport port-security aging time 5
```

 **Secure MAC address aging types**
The default aging type is *absolute* meaning that the timer is not reset upon receiving a frame from the same MAC address.
You can change this by switching to the *inactivity* aging type, which resets the timer.
```
SW1(config)# interface f0/1
SW1(config-if)# switchport port-security aging type aging-type

SW1(config-if)# switchport port-security aging type inactivity
```

 **Static Secure MAC Address Aging**
Manually configured static MAC address do not age out and usually need to be manually removed. However this can be changed with:
```
SW1(config)# interface f0/1
SW1(config-if)# switchport port-security aging static
```

#### Verify Port Security
- Port Security for all interfaces:
  ```
  S1# show port-security
  ```
- **Port Security for a Specific Interface**:
  ```
  S1# show port-security interface interface
  
  S1# show port-security interface fastethernet 0/1
  ```
- **Verify Learned MAC Addresses**
  ```
  S1# show run interface interface
  
  S1# show run interface fa0/1
  ```
- **Verify Secure MAC Addresses**
    ```
  S1# show port-security address  
    ```

### Mitigating VLAN Attacks
VLAN hopping can be accomplished  in three ways:
- Spoofing DTP messages from the attacking host to cause the switch to enter trunking mode. From here, the attacker can send traffic tagged with the target VLAN and the switch then delivers the packets to the destination.
- Introducing a rogue switch and enabling trunking. The attacker can then access all the VLANs on the victim switch from the rogue switch.
- Another type of VLAN hopping attack is a double-tagging attack. 

#### Steps to mitigate VLAN hopping
1. Disable DTP (auto-trunking) negotiations on non-trunking ports by using the `switchport mode access` interface configuration command.
2. Disable unused ports and put them in an unused VLAN
3. Manually enable the trunk link on a trunking port by using the `switchport mode trunk` command
4. Disable DTP (auto-trunking) negotiations n trunking ports by using the `switchport nonegotiate` command
5. Set the native VLAN to a VLAN other than VLAN 1 by using the `switchport trunk native vlan vlan-number` command.

### Mitigating DHCP Attacks
In a DHCP poisoning attack an attacker configures a rogue DHCP server that leases IP addresses so the clients uses it as their default gateway. 

#### DHCP Snooping 
DHCP snooping is a security feature on Cisco switches that examines and filters DHCP messages. 
To enable and activate DHCP snooping use:
```
SW1(config)# ip dhcp snooping
SW1(conifg)# ip dhcp snooping vlan vlan-id

SW1(conifg)# ip dhcp snooping vlan 4
```

You can also activate DHCP Snooping on multiple VLANs, as it is advised to enable DHCP snooping in every VLAN that has hosts using DHCP.
```
SW1(config)# ip dhcp snooping vlan 1-10
SW1(config)# ip dhcp snooping vlan 1,2,3-5,6,7-10
```

==How DHCP snooping works==

**Trusted and untrusted ports**
Packets received on untrusted ports are filtered by DHCP snooping and all ports are untrusted by default. Frames received on trusted ports are allowed, but you have to manually configure each trusted port with:
```
SW1(conifg)# interface g0/1
SW1(config-if)# ip dhcp snooping trust
```

Ports that face towards the DHCP server should be trusted and DHCP snooping will forward DHCP messages on those ports without inspection.
Ports that face away from the server should be untrusted and will be inspected as follows:
- If it is a DHCP server (OFFER, ACK or NAK) message discard it
- If it is a DHCP client message (DISCOVER, REQUEST, DECLINE or RELEASE) inspect it further 
- If a client successfully leases an IP address, create a new entry in the DHCP Snooping binding table
