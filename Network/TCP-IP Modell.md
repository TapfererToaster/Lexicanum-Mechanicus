#CCNA 
# Five Layer Model and OSI
The TCP/IP model defined in RFC 1122 has four layers, however network engineers reference a five-layer TCP model, as it is more useful for understanding networking.

![[TCP-IP model.png]]
# The Layers
Each layer provides an essential function to enable communication over a network.
The communication could be a web browser communicating with a web server.

- Layer
## Physical Layer

> [!definition] Definition
> The **Physical Layer** defines the *physical requirements* for transmitting data from one node to another, such as ports, connectors, cables and how data should be encoded.
> 
> This layer is parallel to the [[(OSI) Open Systems Interconnection-Modell#1. Physische Schicht (Physical, Layer 1)|OSI Layer 1]]

In IEEE 802.3 [[Ethernet]] defines connectors and cable types, as well as how data should be encoded into electrical or light signals among other minutiae about how to communicate.
[[WLAN#IEEE 802.11 standards|IEEE 802.11]] defines what radio waves should be modulated to encode data, etc.

>[!note]
>Scheinbar ist diese Schicht streng genommen nicht teil von dem TCP/IP Stack 
## Data Link Layer
>[!definition] Definition
>The **Data Link Layer** defines how data is addressed and is responsible for *hop-to-hop* delivery of messages, with the use of MAC addresses.
>
>This layer is parallel to the [[(OSI) Open Systems Interconnection-Modell#2. Datensicherungsschicht (Data Link, Layer 2)| OSI Layer 2]]. 

This Layer is responsible to prepare data for transmission over the physical medium to the next node, this node is a router or the destination device.
>[!info]
>Switches do not count as hops.

At each hop, the MAC address is changed to the MAC address of the next hop and sent to it.

![[Data-Link-Layer Hop-to-Hop.png]]

This layer does technically not define the network access as in the OSI Model, but  specifies how the IP-Protocol interacts with other protocols.

## Network / Internet Layer
>[!definition]
>The **Network Layer** uses IP addresses to provide *end-to-end* delivery of messages.
>
>This layer is parallel to the [[(OSI) Open Systems Interconnection-Modell#3. Netzwerk Schicht (Network, Layer 3)|OSI Layer 3]].

The Data Link Layer provides hop-to-hop delivery this layer is responsible for end-to-end delivery from the original source host to the final destination host. 
![[End-to-end delivery.png]]
## Transport Layer
>[!definition]
>The **Transport Layer** uses *port numbers* to ensure that data reaches the correct application process on the destination host. (*application-to-application* delivery)
>
>This layer is parallel to the [[(OSI) Open Systems Interconnection-Modell#4. Transportschicht (Transport, Layer 4)|OSI Layer 4]].

By addressing a message to a specific port, you can send data to specific application processes, which enables you to have multiple processes running simultaneously (f.e. web browser with multiple tabs, online games, etc.). 

![[Layer 4.png]]
## Application Layer
>[!definition]
>The **Application Layer** is the *interface* between applications and the network. Using Layer 7 protocols an application running on a computer can prepare a message to be sent over the network.
>
>This layer is parallel to the [[(OSI) Open Systems Interconnection-Modell#5. Sitzungsschicht (Session, Layer 5)|Layer 5]], [[(OSI) Open Systems Interconnection-Modell#6. Darstellungsschicht (Presentation, Layer 6)|Layer 6]] and [[(OSI) Open Systems Interconnection-Modell#7. Anwendungsschicht (Application, Layer 7)|Layer 7]].

# Data encapsulation and de-encapsulation
## Data Encapsulation
To send data the host has to go through the process of *data encapsulation*, where each layer adds data before it is send.
This process can be broken up into 5 steps:
1. **Application Layer** protocol prepares data
2. **Transport Layer** encapsulates the data with a header addressed to a port number on the destination host
3. **Network Layer** encapsulates the data with a header addressed to the IP address of the destination host
4. **Data Link Layer** encapsulates data with a header addressed to the MAC address of the next hop and a trailer, used to check for errors.
5. The host transmits the bits of data over the physical medium (electrical/ light/ radio waves)

>[!definition]
>A *header* is supplemental data added to the front of a message that is to be transmitted over a network. A protocol's header contains the data used by that protocol.
>
>A *trailer* is supplemental data added to the end of a message that is to be transmitted over a network.

## Data De-encapsulation
When the destination host receives the message, it goes through the opposite process: *de-encapsulation*, which can also be broken down into five steps:
1. The destination host receives the message
2. It inspects Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) header and trailer, removes them and passes the message to Layer 3
3. It inspects the Layer 3 (Network Layer), removes it and passes the message to Layer 4
4. It inspects the Layer 4 header, removes it and sends the data to the appropriate application
5. The application receives and processes the data

![[Data de-encapsulation.png]]

# Protocol Data Units (PDU)
Each Layer has its own name for the combination of the data/ message and the Layers header/ trailer during the (de-)encapulation process:
- Transport Layer: *segment* or L4PDU
- Network Layer: *packet* or L3PDU
- Data Link Layer: *frame* or L2PDU

>[!note]
>The content of the each PDU is called *payload*. 
>Meaning that a *frames* payload is a packet and a *packets* payload is a segment and the *segments* payload is the application data.

![[Protocol Data Unit (PDU).png]]

# Adjacent-Layer and Same-Layer Interactions
Each Layer of the TCP/IP model provides a service for the layer above it, this is called *adjacent-layer interaction*:
- Transport Layer provides a services to Layer 7 (Application Layer) by delivering the data to the appropriate application on the destination host
- Network provides a service to Layer 4 by delivering the segment to the correct destination host
- Data Link provides a service to Layer 3 by delivering the packets to the next hop
- Physical provides a service to Layer 2 by providing a physical medium for frames to travel over.

*Same-layer interaction* refers to the communication between the same layer on different computers:
- Application data from one computer is sent to an application on another computer
- The segment of Layer 4 (Transport) is addressed to Layer 4 of the destination host, where the information in the header will be inspected
- The packet of Layer 3 (Network) is addressed to Layer 3 of the destination host, where the information in the header will be inspected
- The frame of Layer 2 (Data Link) is addressed to the Layer 2 of the next hop, where the information in the header and trailer will be inspected
- Signals sent out of a physical port of one device are received by a physical port of another device.
