# Copper Twisted-Pair Connections

>[!note]
>TP cables are often called "Ethernet cables", but be aware that Ethernet is a standard that makes use of both TP and fibre-optic cables

## Connector
Twisted-Pair cables use a *8 position 8 contact (8P8C)* connector, often referred to as a *Registered Jack-45 (RJ45)* connector.

>[!note]
>The RJ stand for "Registered Jack"
## Schirmarten
Twisted-Pair cables can have different buildups, which protect them from interference:
- *Unshielded (U)*:
  Inside the cable are only the wire pairs and no further components
  -> no protection against *electromagnetic interference (EMI)* 
- Shielded (S):
  A metallic shield, is either wrapped around all wires 
  -> protected against EMI
-  Foiled (F):
  A metallic foil is either wrapped around all wires (F/xTP) or every wire pair individually (FTP)
  -> protected against EMI
  
  >[!note] Cabling Terminology
  >To describe the type of cable we use the form *XX/YZZ*:
  >- XX: What shield is wrapped around all cables
  >- Y: What shield is wrapped around the individual wire-pairs
  >- ZZ: What type of wire-pair is used 
  > 
  >Possible cable types are:
  >- F/UTP
  >- SF/UTP
  >- U/FTP
  >- S/FTP

## IEEE 802.3 standards
The [[Ethernet|IEEE 802.3 Ethernet]] standard defined various standards for TP cabling, some of them are:

## Straight-though and Crossover Cables
>[!note] 
>Not all Ethernet standards use all 4 pairs of wires of the 8P8C connector.
>- 10BASE-T:       4 wires
>- 100BASE-T:     4 wires
>- 1000BASE-T:   8 wires
>- 10GBASE-T:     8 wires

### Straight-through Cables
10BASE-T and 100BASE-T use two wire pairs one for transmission and one for receiving:
![[Straight-trhough wireing.png|585]]
Straight-through cables connects one pin pair to the same pins on the other device, this works well when connecting a PC to a switch. However when connecting two devices of the same type (PCs, switches, ...), data collision would occur, as the same pins are used for transmission or receiving.

### Auto MDI-X
*Auto Medium-Dependent Interface Crossover (Auto MDI-X)* is a feature that allows modern devices to change the pins it uses for transmission and receiving

>[!note] 1000BASE-T and 10GBASE-T
>  1000BASE-T and 10GBASE-T use all eight wires and every pair can be used for transmitting and receiving data simultaneously.
## Rollover
Rollover cables are used to connect a PC to the RJ45 Console port of networking devices.

# Fiber-optic connections
## Anatomy
Fiber-optic connections have two cables, one for transmission and one for receiving. These are connected to a *Small Form-Factor Pluggable (SFP)*, which is plugged into a SFP port on a device.
>[!note]
>When connecting two devices, the SFP transceivers have to be plugged the correct way. The transmitter must be connected to the others receiver and vice versa. 

A fiber-optic cable is made up of a glass core surrounded by multiple layers:

![[Fibre-optic anatomy.png]] 
- **1.) Glass Core**:
  very thin glass fiber, used to transport the signal
- **2.) Cladding**:
  reflective layer that helps to transport the light
- **3.) Buffer**:
  protects the inner components
- **4.) Outer jacket**:
  protects the inner components
### Multimode and Singlemode
There are two main types of fiber-optic cables
- *Multimode fiber (MMF)*
- *Single-mode fiber (SMF)*

![[SMF MMF.png]]

MMF cables have a wide core and use a LED transmitter that emits light at multiple angles (*modes*), which are reflected by the cladding.
SMF have a thin core and use a laser transmitter that emits light at a single angle.

# UTP vs. Fiber
**Fiber**:
- support greater distances
